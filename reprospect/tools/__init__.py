"""
Tools for analyzing and profiling CUDA applications.

This module provides:
- Architecture definitions (compute capabilities, GPU families)
- Binary analysis tools (cuobjdump, nvdisasm, ELF parsing)
- Profiling interfaces (Nsight Compute, Nsight Systems)
- SASS (assembly) decoding and control flow analysis
- Device property queries

Key submodules:
- architecture: NVIDIA GPU architecture definitions
- binaries: Tools for working with CUDA binaries
- ncu: Nsight Compute profiling interface
- sass: SASS instruction decoding and analysis
- device_properties: CUDA device property queries
